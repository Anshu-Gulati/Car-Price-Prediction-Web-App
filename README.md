## How this project does?

1. First of all the data was scraped from Quikr.com (https://quikr.com) 

2. The data was cleaned (it was super unclean :( ) and analysed.

3. Then a Linear Regression model was built on top of it which had 0.92 R2_score.


4. This project was given the form of an website built on Flask where we used the Linear Regression model to perform predictions.
